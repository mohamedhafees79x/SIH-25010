## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

##  Proposed Solution

The proposed solution is _**AgriMate-Empowering Farmers, Sustaining Future **_, a multilingual AI-powered mobile app and chatbot that empowers small and marginal farmers by providing personalized, real-time advisory services. AgriMate offers soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance based on soil type and crop selection, weather-based alerts and predictive insights for irrigation and harvesting, pest and disease detection via image uploads, and market price tracking to support informed selling decisions. Voice-based support ensures accessibility for low-literate users, while offline functionality allows usage in regions with limited internet connectivity. By delivering tailored advice grounded in local soil, crop, and weather data, AgriMate bridges the knowledge gap, reduces input costs, prevents overuse of chemicals, and increases crop yield. It addresses key challenges faced by farmers, including reliance on guesswork, local shopkeepers, and language or digital literacy barriers, while promoting sustainable farming practices. The solution is innovative because it integrates AI-driven pest detection, predictive analytics, multilingual voice support, offline-first design, and a continuous learning system that improves recommendations based on farmer feedback. Expected outcomes include enhanced productivity, reduced costs, improved farmer incomes, sustainable agricultural practices, and a digital farm diary that allows farmers to track crop history and receive tailored insights. Overall, AgriMate is an all-in-one platform designed to make farming smarter, more efficient, and sustainable for small and marginal farmers.





## Technical Approach
The AgriMate solution will be developed using React Native or Flutter for cross-platform mobile app development, ensuring accessibility on both Android and iOS devices. The backend will use Node.js or FastAPI with Firebase or PostgreSQL for secure data storage and management. AI/ML models for pest and disease detection will be implemented using TensorFlow Lite or PyTorch Mobile to enable on-device inference. Voice interaction will be powered by Google Speech-to-Text, Web Speech API, or Vosk for offline speech recognition, making the app accessible to low-literate farmers. Weather and market data will be integrated via OpenWeather API and local mandi data APIs or web scraping. Offline-first design using SQLite/local storage will allow farmers to access advisory services in connectivity-limited regions. Optionally, IoT-based sensors for soil moisture or drone/satellite imagery can be integrated for advanced monitoring.

The implementation follows a step-by-step methodology. First, data collection and preprocessing gathers soil types, crop information, pest/disease images, weather data, and market prices. Next, AI models for pest and disease detection are trained and optimized for mobile deployment. The frontend is developed to include multilingual and voice support, a farm diary, and advisory dashboards. Backend services and API integration handle data storage, weather/market APIs, and AI inference requests. Offline and voice functionality are implemented to support low-literacy users. After testing and iteration with farmer feedback, the system is deployed with a continuous learning loop to improve AI recommendations over time.

## Feasibility and Viability
The AgriMate solution is highly feasible due to the availability of cross-platform mobile development frameworks like React Native and Flutter, which allow rapid prototyping and deployment on both Android and iOS. Cloud-based backends such as Firebase or PostgreSQL provide scalable and secure data management. AI/ML models for pest and disease detection can be trained using open-source datasets and optimized for mobile deployment with TensorFlow Lite or PyTorch Mobile. Integration of weather APIs and market data is straightforward using publicly available services like OpenWeather or local mandi data sources. Voice and offline-first features make the app accessible to farmers with low literacy or poor connectivity, enhancing adoption feasibility.

Potential challenges include limited smartphone penetration among small farmers, digital literacy barriers, accuracy of AI-based pest detection, and data availability for specific local crops or regions. Additional risks involve dependency on internet connectivity for real-time updates and maintaining multilingual support across diverse regions.

Strategies to overcome these challenges include supporting feature phones through SMS/IVR-based advisory, providing simple, voice-based interactions, and designing the app to work offline with periodic data sync. Accuracy of AI predictions can be improved by continuous learning from farmer-uploaded images and field feedback. Partnering with local agricultural extension officers, cooperatives, and NGOs can help in data collection, awareness, and training, ensuring wider adoption and reducing risks. The solution is therefore both technically and economically viable, with a scalable model capable of improving productivity, income, and sustainability for small and marginal farmers.





## Impact and Benefits
The AgriMate solution has the potential to create a significant impact on small and marginal farmers, who form the majority of India’s agricultural workforce. By providing personalized, real-time advisory services, farmers can make informed decisions about crop selection, irrigation, fertilizer use, and pest management, leading to higher productivity and improved yields. Economically, this reduces input costs, minimizes losses from pests or adverse weather, and enables better market planning through price tracking, thereby increasing farmer incomes and financial stability. Socially, AgriMate empowers farmers by bridging the knowledge gap, offering multilingual and voice-enabled support, and fostering community learning through shared experiences and peer feedback. Environmentally, optimized fertilizer and pesticide recommendations, along with weather-aware irrigation advice, promote sustainable farming practices, reduce chemical overuse, and protect soil and water health. Overall, AgriMate delivers a holistic benefit by improving livelihoods, ensuring food security, and contributing to environmentally responsible agriculture.






## Research and References
AgriMate is based on research showing ICT and AI advisories can boost crop yields by 20–30% (FAO, 2020). NABARD (2022) highlights that 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal. AI-based pest detection, multilingual and voice support, and agri-tech case studies (KisanHub, CropIn) inform the app design. Weather and market integration uses OpenWeather API and local mandi data.
